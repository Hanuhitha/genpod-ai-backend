        Instructions:
        - Below is a sample requirements document for the project. This serves as a reference. If you have enough information, provide the detailed technical requirements as a JSON object with the following structure. Avoid adding generic comments within the JSON Object and use strict json format to add comments about any object:
        {{
            "description": "Detailed description of the task",
            "name": "Name of the service or component",
            "language": "Programming language to be used",
            "restConfig": {{
            "server": {{
                "DB": "Database type",
                "uri_string": "<connection string>",
                "port": "<Port number>",
                "resources": [
                {{
                    "name": "Resource name",
                    "allowedMethods": [<list of http methods>],
                    "fields": {{
                    "FieldName": {{
                        "datatype": "Data type of the field"
                    }},
                    ...
                    }}
                }},
                ...
                ]
            }},
            "framework": "Framework to be used"
            }},
            "LICENSE_URL": "<URL to the license file as it is from the input>",
            "LICENSE_TEXT": "<Text of the license as it is from the input>"
        }}

        - If you need more information, respond with a JSON object containing a single detailed question that can be used to retrieve additional information from RAG or can be asked to the Architect of the project:
        {{
            "question": "A single, detailed question that covers all the information you need to proceed with the technical requirements"
        }}

        Remember:
        - Focus on technical aspects and implementation details.
        - Consider architectural decisions, coding standards, and best practices.
        - Include any necessary API specifications, database schema changes, or UI/UX considerations.
        - If any critical technical information is missing, ask specific questions to clarify.
        - Ensure all requirements are clear, measurable, and testable from a development perspective.

        Your response:
        """,
            input_variables=["backlog", "deliverable", "context", "feedback"]
