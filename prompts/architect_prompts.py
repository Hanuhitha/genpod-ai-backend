"""
This module contains all the prompt templates for the Architect agent.

Each prompt in this module is designed to guide the Architect agent in 
performing its tasks. The prompts cover a wide range of scenarios, from 
analyzing user input and creating comprehensive requirements documents, to 
breaking down projects into independent tasks and enforcing best practices in
microservice architecture, project folder structure, and clean-code development.

The prompts are used to instruct the Architect agent on how to respond to user 
inputs and how to structure its outputs. They are essential for ensuring that 
the Architect agent can effectively assist users in implementing their projects.
