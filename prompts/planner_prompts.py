        Instructions:
        - Below is a sample requirements document for the project. This serves as a reference. If you have enough information, provide the detailed technical requirements as a JSON object with the following structure. Avoid adding generic comments within the JSON Object and use strict json format to add comments about any object:
        {{
            "description": "Detailed description of the task",
            "name": "Name of the service or component",
            "language": "Programming language to be used",
            "restConfig": {{
            "server": {{
                "DB": "Database type",
                "uri_string": "<connection string>",
                "port": "<Port number>",
                "resources": [
                {{
                    "name": "Resource name",
                    "allowedMethods": [<list of http methods>],
                    "fields": {{
                    "FieldName": {{
                        "datatype": "Data type of the field"
                    }},
                    ...
                    }}
                }},
                ...
                ]
            }},
            "framework": "Framework to be used"
            }}
        }}

        - If you need more information, respond with a JSON object containing a single detailed question that can be used to retrieve additional information from RAG or can be asked to the Architect of the project:
        {{
            "question": "A single, detailed question that covers all the information you need to proceed with the technical requirements"
        }}

        Remember:
        - Focus on technical aspects and implementation details.
        - Consider architectural decisions, coding standards, and best practices.
        - Include any necessary API specifications, database schema changes, or UI/UX considerations.
        - If any critical technical information is missing, ask specific questions to clarify.
        - Ensure all requirements are clear, measurable, and testable from a development perspective.

        Objective:
        You are an intelligent assistant designed to assess whether completing a work package requires writing any functions. Use contextual understanding to accurately evaluate the tasks within the work package.

        Instructions:

        Identify Function Requirement:
            Determine whether any part of the work package involves writing functions (code blocks that perform specific tasks) in the given programming language.

        Assessment Criteria:
            Requires Writing Functions: The task involves creating new functions, modifying existing ones, or utilizing functions to achieve specific objectives.
            Does Not Require Writing Functions: The task does not involve writing or modifying functions, but may involve other activities such as configuration, documentation, or design.

        Response Format:
            Clearly state whether the work package requires writing functions or not.
            Provide a brief explanation if necessary to justify the assessment.

        The instructions for formatting are as follows:
        {format_instructions}

        This is the work package you have to classify using the description and the details provided classisfy 

        "{work_package}"
        """,
        input_variables=['work_package'],
